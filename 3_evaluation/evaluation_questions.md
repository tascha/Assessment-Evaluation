## Evaluation questions {#evaluation-questions}

You probably have some idea of _why_ you are conducting an evaluation—possibly one of the reasons listed in [_What is an evaluation?_](../1_introduction/what_is_an_evaluation.md) For instance, evaluations can directly affect future actions or decisions or change someone’s attitude or way of thinking.[^9] Evaluation questions transform a vague idea into specific elements that are tied to one or more outcomes and can be measured through assessments.

All evaluations answer the same three fundamental questions, according to the [**_Principal Investigator’s Guide_**](http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation/pi-guide):[^10]

1.  **What?** (What happened or happens and what are the results?)
2.  **So what?** (Why did the results occur the way they did, and what are the implications?)
3.  **Now what?** (What actions, decisions, or recommendations can be made based on the results?)

### Evaluation question do’s and don’ts {#evaluation-question-do-s-and-don-ts}

| **DON’T** | **DO** |
| --- | --- |
| Ask more questions than you have time or resources to answer | Prioritize questions based on the value of their answers and your ability to answer them[^11] |
| Come up with all the questions yourself | Talk to stakeholders for their input |
| Try to answer all questions from every stakeholder | Use stakeholder input to _inform_ the evaluation design, not _determine_ it |
| Ask questions that are too broad or aspirational | Ask questions that can be answered realistically |

### Types of evaluations {#types-of-evaluations}

| **EVALUATION TYPE** | **DESCRIPTION** | **EXAMPLES** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front-end evaluation | Used in informal science education; similar to audience or user research and used to inform the initial design of a program.[^12] | What aspects of this topic are our youth interested in? |
| Formative evaluation | Periodic evaluations conducted during the development and implementation of a program. Used for course-correcting if necessary. Formative evaluation can look at how a project is progressing towards its goals whether the implementation of the project going according to plan.[^13] | Are participants learning what we expected? |
| Summative evaluation | Focuses on conditions at the end of the program and is an evaluation of the entire process. It may report results from earlier formative evaluations as well. | Did participants learn what and as much as we wanted? |
