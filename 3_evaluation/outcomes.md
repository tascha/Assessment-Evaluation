## Outcomes {#outcomes}

Outcomes are the differences your programs make for your library’s youth and for the community—things outside of your program and outside of connected learning that matter.<sup><sup id="174453654767466-footnote-ref-8"><a href="#174453654767466-footnote-8">[8]</a></sup></sup> If you are evaluating a program or other connected learning activity, you may have already determined the desired outcomes (see the Connected Learning Programming module for more).

**OUTCOME EXAMPLES**
