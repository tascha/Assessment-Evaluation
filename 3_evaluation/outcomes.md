## Outcomes {#outcomes}

Outcomes are the differences your programs make for your library’s youth and for the community—things outside of your program and outside of connected learning that matter.[^8] If you are evaluating a program or other connected learning activity, you may have already determined the desired outcomes (see the Connected Learning Programming module for more).
